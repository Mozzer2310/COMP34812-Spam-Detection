Toad was literally the only Toad brave enough to go with her, meaning she was pretty much on her own for this adventure otherwise.  Then she meets another human like herself for the first time that wants to go to save his brother.  When Mario demanded to go, she gave him a day to complete a course to prove he wouldn't slow her down. She had already planned to head out to the Kong's island the next day.  So she didn't spend any extra time on him.

When he heard his dad would send the Kong army (and therefore Donkey Kong himself) if mario beat him in a fight, DK might have gone easy on mario so that he could see some real action.
