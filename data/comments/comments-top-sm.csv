Came in for the embers
Stayed out for the breeze
I need to feel elements to remind me
There's beauty when it's bleak
Stuck out long before lights down
Why do I breathe? Oh, I know
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe, I won't
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't br–µak my boat
Stones crash on the boardwalk
The wind rush through th–µ trees
I'll keep my eyes peeled
The memories always fall short
Of what we could've been
Left out long before last call
What do I need? Oh, I know
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe, I won't
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't break my boat
The waves won't break my boat
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe, I won't
And the waves won't break my boat", ü è Ä…™·¥Ñs  ô è  ú·¥Ä Ä Ä è,0

For example, lets say u give one phone a 8 and another a 7.5 for one category and for the next category u give the first phone a 2 and the second one a 9.

mMaBVfIedFw,Selfie Waves,UgygLt80y7oRQZCMySd4AaABAg,"I‚Äôve been watching your videos almost exclusively lately- truly the bulk of my watchable entertainment over the last month. Two MindField videos made me think you were going to address something I‚Äôve thought about for a long time actually and I‚Äôd love for you to explore it further. Essentially the topic is about how it seems (for most humans, including neurodiverse people like myself) that the more intelligence we have in one respect, the more we have to give up in another, maybe a few others. You addressed it regarding animals vs humans. And it was clear that music came as naturally to Derek Paravicini as communication does to most humans and vice versa. We know there are many different types of intelligence. I have viewed most of us as being around average in most ways, with some strengths and some weaknesses, still with no extreme deficits or surpluses. This is why the savants of the world get our attention. And it has always seemed to me that they do have what would be considered an extreme deficit in some area, due to the extreme surplus of intelligence in another. I also recently learned that hyperlexia is a condition to be ‚Äúdiagnosed.‚Äù Why would a child be considered ‚Äútoo good‚Äù at reading or understanding numbers? Why is there a list of ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù? Well it‚Äôs almost always accompanied by autism. Even just amongst neurotypical people, there has long been a trope of cool athletes (with great interpersonal and bodily-kinetic intelligence) to be ‚Äúdumb‚Äù (with low mathematical and linguistic intelligence) and nerds (with high mathematical and linguistic intelligence) to be awkward (with low athletic and interpersonal intelligence). Is there SOME basis for these assumptions? Anyways it‚Äôs all very fascinating to me. I guess the video I‚Äôd love to see from you boils down to 2 questions- Can anyone excel at everything? Does everyone essentially have the same threshold for intelligence, only different types expressed in different ways?


Basically, if every type of intelligence (logical, linguistic, musical, spatial, etc) could be measured in an accurate, numerical way, and everyone were to be tested on every type of intelligence, and we were add up each individual‚Äôs scores for each category, would we all essentially end up with the same final score? (I‚Äôd like to clarify that I‚Äôm speaking mostly of natural ability, not cases where someone may have been trained to do something well but it‚Äôs actually not natural for them.)",Ray Elle,0

xLu_YNGAIIY,The Last Dream SMP Video Ever,UgzXb_OgmXUmA8HYGvl4AaABAg,It honestly hit me hard how his animals are still in the right place. How his setup armour was in the barrel waiting for his next big plot point. It feels incredibly weird how someone who gave you so much hours of fun time is now dead.  Seeing how he was so young and good makes me want to not waste time and do more about myself. As well as helping others. I hope I will be able to waste less time on meaningless things and concentrate on self improvement. Farewell  TechnoBlade o7.,Klaudiusz Skurzy≈Ñski,0

I don't think we'll ever get the same experience from anything else. This was my therapy. This was my center of joy. This is where instead of crying tears of sadness, I cried tears of joy.

I just hope they improve the feeling of aiming on controller, it feels wonky asf. Other than that, XDefiant has real potential and can appeal to Call of Duty fans like me that don't like the direction the franchise has gone in the past few years.

The guns feel great, the movement and the maps are great and flow well. The aim assist is not that strong(coming from a controller player) aim assist in the recent cods is so strong and no sbmm in casual is so good. I just came back to mw2 after 2 weeks, hopped into snd and got zero kills because I was not playing at my skill level that I normally do since I was so rusty, also going from Xdefiant movement back to mw2 really made me realize how terrible the movement is in mw. I have Orion and everything and was still so lost wondering things like ""how do you even play this game again"" because there's just nothing to do. No mechanics to learn and use or anything you just run around and shoot people and holy do guns aim slow. I will definitely grind out Xdefiant camos and challenges and what's even better?

I do my notes and am in more of a ""student"" mode in other parts of the day. For example, I am working on the Google Certificate for Data Analytics.

However, I really worry about the future of kids like this having apparently not been brought up to know the true value of money, and being thrust into the spotlight like this. Kids go through many different stages in their formative years, and with having everything handed to her on a plate at this age including the laughable entourage, what is she going to turn into in her late teens and beyond? I really hope she doesn‚Äôt change from the cute, articulate little person she is now, but somehow, Im sad to say, I think that its highly likely. Parents, take her away from the spotlight and let her grow up like a normal 10 year old, doing normal things and learn the value of money, hard work and dedication (like Yianni does with his kids) and she will turn out just fine.",Clive Hutton,0

Originally the main house, which was 5 floors, was connected to a house in the next street (Chesterfield Street) which we bought for the staff. There was an underground tunnel connecting the two houses, which was tunnelled underneath the courtyard. 
Brings back memories, and the Brunei Investment  Agency took it over from the Prince in around 2005.
A very majestic house and very impressed with what John has done with the house.",JR Bradbury,0
