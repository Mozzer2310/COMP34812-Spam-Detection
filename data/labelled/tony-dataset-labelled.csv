Anyway, a few pointers to the gauntlet:
    1. Starting the run from a wallride before the start gives some extra speed. 
    2. The reasoin arc grenades don't hit seem to be no LoS. The small platforms sometimes apparently block the grenades LoS so it doesn't hit. 

Also I believe the first Pilot helmet is bit sooner, on the drop pod with the prowlers. I might be wrong tho, it's been a few months for me",Rans0mware,ham

Can't you just make it move faster?
Lovely to be sitting here with you
You're kinda cute but it's raining harder
My shoes are now full of water
Lovely to be rained on with you
It's kinda cute but it's so short
Then you're drivin' me home
And I don't wanna leave
But I have to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
Before
Bedsheets, no clothes
Touch me like nobody else does
Lovely to just lay here with you
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos
But it's over
Then you're drivin' me home
And it kinda comes out as I get up to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
But it's not real
And you don't exist
And I can't recall the last time I was kissed
It hits me in the car
And it feels like the end of a movie I've seen before
Before",AnuShri,ham

6x7Sbiy5Pw0,How to SHOOT WITH POWER Regardless of your Technique,Ugy1m2TpZrgp8oyRW-Z4AaABAg,"I'm the proud owner of a powerful and accurate left foot.. I love free kicks and in my years and teams I've played at.. I took most of the corners and free kicks.
This was a great video and I'm sure it will help a lot that struggle. That said.. I feel some parts were overlooked so I'll add this:
""Kick with your knee"" Keep your heel back against your hammy until your knee is down to the ball.. and then drop your foot to the ball.¬†It gives a whipping effect
Arms are not just for balance.. it's your bodys way to counter motion the energy from the twisting movement. Your arms should move at the same pace as your legs!!

Mihajlovic.. Beckham.. Carlos or whoever.. in slow mo.. take note their heel and knee before kicking.. and that extended opposing arm speed as they kick!",djfunkychicken,ham

6x7Sbiy5Pw0,How to SHOOT WITH POWER Regardless of your Technique,UgyXs5CCVa31aqQaLGt4AaABAg,"If i may i'll add a couple of things. There are 2 aspects of the topic shooting with power, 1: technique, which this video revolves around, and secondly: physical ability like agility and raw power.
A few tips, the shot i tried to master through my playing days was the Roberto Carlos like all-in style from distance. As a big kid i grew my legs to a huge size(86cm thighs and 51 cm. calves) by doing a lot of accelerations on my mountainbike, i rode that thing everywhere, so those wide tires and always pushing myself to the limit on the bike helped develop quick fibered musclemass. I also had a thing with stairs, i never just did one step, i always did 2 og 3 steps at the time. 
I think an underated thing about shooting with power is agility and flexibility. If you practice thorough stretching after efforts, your muscles and ligaments will gain some length which in the kicking of the ball will add some free movement, which will increase power in the followthrough, also there is the lowering of risk of injuries.
When i praticed i kicked as hard as i could everytime, that i think also gained power over the years, but could i go back i'd take 5 percent of the top and focus a lot more on technique. 
I got the power up to where i have never seen anyone kick as hard as I could, but my technique was flawed at best. And i could kick so hard that I was afraid of hitting the wall, that was always my main concern! I know as a 17 year old, that i kicked 127km/t that was the last measument of it i know, but at 20 -21 it was much harder, maybe 140-150 km/t. The ball whistled in the air!
Anyway I could talk for hours about that, but this is getting long, so tha'ts it for me:)",SteveRiverwood,ham

Think of your foot and its motion like a cue stick when playing pool.
Approach on an angle (about 45 angle) and lunge onto the the ball.. leaning to the side and lean back enough to make sure knee is behind the ball but also try keeping upper body vertical (body shape look like 4 to 5 o'clock) Going on an angle lets your foot contact more of the underside of the ball.
*Side note*
The fear of toes hitting the ground takes a while for some to overcome but leaning to the side makes it physically impossible. 

Put ALL your energy and thrust once your foot is a ball length PAST the ball.. and follow through is just as important.. so make sure your 'cue stick' leg/foot motion gives it the upwards direction.

If you're in a fight.. your hardest kick wouldn't need a run up right? So neither does your longest distance kick.. 1 or 2 steps is easily done.

If your knee is over the ball it will never go upwards. Try kicking it as you did but push your hip slightly forward and follow your body through the ball.
Lean back a little more and kicking knee behind the ball if you want it to go high. (gotta get under it to lift)",djfunkychicken,ham

Let me lay it out: there is quite obviously a difference between Winona Ryder shoplifting clothes from a charity shop, and a battered wife on the run from her husband, with two kids to feed, shoplifting some bread from Tesco. There is a whole spectrum of moral culpability when it comes to theft, and it's not just pure ethics, it factors into the law regarding shoplifting too. Any theoretical legal punishment will necessarily take into account the differences in the two cases and punish Winona Ryder more harshly than the mother of two.

It had been something that was not talked about in the family and she'd only found out when he'd died.
She is the sweetest, kindest person and we assured her that everyone makes their own decisions but that it would have also been incredibly difficult for her Grandfather during that time.

I learned that my grandpa just got there when the war was declared over and had to travel back home by foot. He met refugees from concentration camps in the woods in Czechia.

Yes, I wasn't a part of this and neither were my parents, but I know the stories of my grandparents, who were children themselves at the time.

We are not immune to becoming those people and that is something important to know.


Patriotism is not very popular in Germany, as you stated in your video. This pride has led to horrible things happening and when you think about it, is there a reason for patriotism? For most people it is not really an accomplishment to be in a country. But what is more common is ""city patriotism"". Your village, town or city is more direct to you.

I do remember being taught about the French Revolution, industrialization, and the middle ages, but even slavery / US history in general wasn't addressed in history class but English class instead (quite brief and not exactly focused on the history itself but more in the vein of ""look, here's some new words to learn"")",Remy,0

1. we could cover so many eras of history in-depth instead, without going anywhere near ""ignoring"" WWII. For example, we were taught about the Cold War within 3 weeks, that's 6 hours of class.

It is the ONLY part of history that is taught with that aim in mind. everything else is just remembering names, places, dates and years. Never ever have I heard something akin to ""You know, Rome accomplished many things, conquered many lands and even integrated their culture into their own, which is really impressive. But the one mistake they made was to put the current sovereign on a level with the principle of ""sovereignty"" itself. The ruler abided by no rules, couldn't be stopped by anything except for murder and here are the things that went south because of that. That is prove enough of why Totalitarianism doesn't work.""

#NAME?,How Do German Schools Teach About WWII?,UgydnEUllqvCI8H78m54AaABAg,"As a German that went through the school system (completed my ""Abitur"" in 2014 which qualifies you for higher education at a university), I can tell you that a lot of it depends on the teacher and thus that there's still a lot of variation how the topic is treated within singular schools at times. There was a teacher at my school where the students definitely felt an implied ""original sin"" being seemingly pressed on them despite them not having any hand in what the Nazis did. I heard him speak on the topic once or twice, and I understood the people in his class feeling that way. The type of guy that would apologize to a Jewish person for what our ancestors did. Like why? We know it was horrible and wrong, thje jews know it was horrible and wrong, and it should never be allowed to happen again. You didn't do it, so you shouldn't have to feel guilty for it because you had absolutely no hand in it. Most Germans I've talked to about it will tell you that sometimes teachers take it too far with the ""guilt because you happen to be German"" thing. Trust me, we know. We hear all about it in school, as mentioned in the video. They focus a lot on the holocaust, and that's the primary and most monstrous atrocity committed by the Nazis. You read books that portray how the discrimination, segregation and finally extermination of ""unwanted elements"" (not only Jews, but Sinti and Roma people as well for instance) actually worked and gradually became worse and worse. And the caution on what to show your young students and what might be too much for them to digest often goes right out the window when this topic is being dealt with, and I think rightfully so. Seeing a few graphic images helps you take it for what it truly was. We visited a former concentration camp on a class trip, we visited a museum that detailed the fate of a local Jewish community in a very rural place in our area, all of that. They went the extra mile.

TLDR: Especially the topic of the atrocities committed by the Nazis is taken very seriously and featured prominently, but some teachers take it too far with the ""guilt tripping"" aspect. Don't teach your students to feel guilty for it, they shouldn't, they had no hand in it. Teach them awareness and a responsible way of dealing with the topic.",FusRoDahYaFace,0

#NAME?,How Do German Schools Teach About WWII?,UgwQeYZuJg5didnLQDF4AaABAg,"I, as a recent German high school graduate, do agree with the point of history lessons being a bit to focused on this topic, but I also find it extremely important that people like me who otherwise wouldn't know much about all of this are sensitive towards this topic and groups of people and their ancestors who it has effected in horrifying ways both in and outside of Germany. I'm glad that I am from Germany, I'm very blessed to have grown up in a country like Germany but I'm still deeply ashamed of the past this nation has had. For me the most important thing is that something like WW2 or 1 for that matter (best case scenario any war) ever happens again. There should be nothing more important than freedom and happiness for people who just want to live their lives in peace and respect others.

g1pb2aK2we4,How stretching actually changes your muscles - Malachy McHugh,UgwMtMhayUSsmwSfPZF4AaABAg,"Key phrase - Stretching helps muscles ""retain strength at longer length"".  Stretching is improving strength at the limits of range of motion, thus allowing joints to support (and therefore allow) motion in that extended range.  Well done!",Brian Birsa,0
g1pb2aK2we4,How stretching actually changes your muscles - Malachy McHugh,UgyHw8rcJKDVGTEpoLx4AaABAg,"FINALLY, someone discusses this with nuance! I did medical massage for several years, and I was skeptical that this might be a problematically simplified video, but once the difference between dynamic and static was brought up early on, I knew this would be content that actually does some good. I'd have liked to see some clearer emphasis put on safety factors and the difference between pre-activity and post-activity stretching, and I don't quite like the characterization of proprioceptive limitation as ""pain threshold"", but overall this is a good resource and I'm mostly being nitpicky.

In case anyone sees this, the most important takeaways I think everyone should apply to stretching are: 1. Never hold static stretches at the absolute maximum intensity you can tolerate; instead, find that limit, then lessen the stretch just a tiny bit, then hold it there. It reduces injury risk and is a much more effective ""sweet spot"" for really benefiting. 2. Pressure sensation (such as that felt when a muscle is stretched) will ALWAYS override pain signals, but just because it feels good in the moment doesn't mean you're actually accomplishing anything; pay attention to whether you feel improvement a little while _after_ the stretch. Most people just hold static stretches long enough to feel good right then, instead of long enough to have lasting effect (holding a good 30 seconds or about 3 full breath cycles is about right), which is why it often ends up feeling like a waste of time to many. If you're going to bother doing it, commit to doing it right!

(Also, for those who really want to see radical effects on your range of motion, talk to your massage therapist or physical therapist about post-isometric relaxation or ""PIR"" stretching! Lots of my fellow CMTs might not know the method but many will, and most if not all PTs will know what's up. You can gain, _lastingly,_ up to maybe a dozen degrees or more of range of motion in one joint in just a few minutes, if the technique is done well!)","The plural is actually ""asparageese"".",0

Give the public access to simple features such as sentence prediction... then slowly acclimate the population to higher level features from there"".

Another thing I'm excited about with these large language models are all the insights to be mined from all the data that was parsed. The models used by ChatGPT are a giant data source full of insights that can be queried with natural language. It can take unstructured data and reformat it as structured data.

to the uninitiated, stellaris is a galaxy wide real time strategy game from 2016 that takes place right as we develop the technology to travel to other stars, it has a lot of conflicts but also a lot of diplomacy and politics, the newest update ""first contact"" expands on a very old system that manages the observation, interference, and growth of other pre-sapient or pre-ftl civilizations in the galaxy, and in many cases it behaves exactly as shown in this video, a loud empire will grow and take over many star systems, if they have a policy of non-intervention and protected observation of pre-ftl species then cloaked observation outposts may be orbiting us right now and studying us, if they however have different policies of tolerance or intolerance then we could be easily swept away by aggressive terraforming projects or even purged by fanatic purifiers.

however the same can be said about us if we're in the galactic stage first, we could encounter other pre-ftl races within our sphere of influence, observe and guide them, uplift them only to become our servants, purge them with terraforming, planet crackers, neutron sweeps, orbital bombardment, or mass genocide, or alternatively embrace them as part of our empire, give them their independence, have them become our loyal vassals, and so on. if we are in fact first then we must be careful to tread our future diplomatically and politically since if we are malevolent others will seek to eliminate us, but if we are too benevolent they may take advantage of us. 

another theory is that we could be under the custodianship of a hyper advanced race that simply doesnt want to be bothered by the galactic community - a quiet empire so to speak. in stellaris there are 5 fallen empires which are hyper advanced civilizations with technologies that enter the realm of magic, one of these fallen empires are the enigmatic observers, whom are fond of protecting pre-sapient & pre-ftl civilizations within its dominion - away from the wider galaxy, thus enshrouding us from countless galactic wars that may already have come and gone.",chloe kaftan,0

A book series that put this idea into perspective was The Lost Fleet: Beyond the Frontier. It explores a futuristic spacefaring humanity that just recovered from a galactic war amongst themselves, only to discover another intelligent species residing at the borders of their known space.

They dubbed these aliens the ""Enigma Race"" due to their elusive strategies. Their warships resembled vessels more like cruisers, they suicide-bombed any vessel that could potentially be captured, and even detonated bombs on their own colonized planets to prevent the humans from learning about them. Their evolution made them inherently secretive; an instinct that human scientists in the novel series compared to being as driven by as sex does to us humans. Just as we evolved to not stop thinking about reproduction and advancing our species, the Enigma race evolved to not stop thinking about concealing their race.

I feel like if there existed an intelligent alien race in the Milky Way, they'd most likely have to live by the Enigma race's sort of lifestyle. Which makes the possibility of encountering them a bit scary, to say the least.",TimeToEngage,0

w6JXZ3GzSCQ,The Billion Dollar Scam - BBC World Service,Ugx6FjrCLMvPOEOcUuV4AaABAg.9oSo6BFXB4y9oo6hANTytW,"Absolutely, the absurdity of the whole thing should be obvious to most people with an ounce of common sense. 

Serious investment companies don't speak so informally with investment clients on the phone. They are usually very formal until some relationship is established and a personal investment advisor is assigned. And even at that stage, it would be speaking on a first name basis after asking if that's ok with the client..using 'darling' or 'love' to speak to female clients in an investment fund should be a red flag. It would be highly unprofessional, inappropriate conduct by an employee and unlikely to happen in real companies since most calls are routinely recorded by most large companies and an employee would be mindful of that and how they speak and interact with clients.

The other red flag was the initial contact call. When the person at the call centre was quizzed about which country they were in and from originally and couldn't give a straight answer and was evasive. 

Likewise, making random and speculator returns claims to a client is a massive red flag that you're not dealing with a legitimate investment funds advisor. No investment fund can promise any level of returns, and losses are a distinct possibility and risk. Most real investment funds make that clear to clients, they rarely suggest they can provide any return percentage over any short space of time and always remind investors that capital is at risk and investing is long-term proposition, not something you can expect quick or short-term returns from doing. When you have someone saying you can make 70-90% a week or a day even, you know you're talking to either a scammer or someone who is doing gambling rather than investing. If asked what kind of returns can be expected, a real investment fund would normally quote its average annual performance over a given period of time (or sometimes in their best trading year) and it's usually (for a good fund) something around 10-20% a year. 

It's up anyone investing in a managed equity or investment fund to probe them about historic performance over say the last 3 years, 5 years and 10 years...legitimate investment funds willl have charts of their historic performance on their website for you to look at for any given time period. 

Anyone who has done a bit of basic research online and understands the fundamental basics of investing and has a bit of basic insight into how managed investment funds work wouldn't be an easy victim for these types of scams. Most scammers who operate as badly as this one did would be exposed and fail on the initial contact call after answering a couple of basic questions and just in the way they come across so unprofessionally. 

Some people do fall for them though, as some scammers are quite clever at convincing people they are genuine and the returns are real, often going so far as to create an account getting a client to deposit say $100 and then showing a return of 50% in one week on the balance which you're free to withdraw. So then they're feeling confident the investment firm is safe and genuine. That then encourages someone to deposit more money, ie $1000, for the allure of even higher returns and an income potential. As soon their second deposit is made, their money is gone, along with the original deposit, a substantial portion of it (some excuse is given, ie the market going against them or the account becomes frozen for security checks or whatever). 

I involved in uncovering and bringing litigation against a multi-million pound crypto-currency fraud in the UK a few years ago. Investors lost $10,000's..the company was operated by two Russian's and was actually a fully licensed regulated firm in London with the world's first crypto-debit card. It seemed a totally legitimate company and had over 400 million users worldwide...but after doing some basic checks on the company, I saw red flags early on that the company was a rogue operationa and misleading investors into thinking it was something much bigger than it really was. 

It started off legitimate, but they misappropriated client funds and failed to back Bitcoin positions (exploiting the very relaxed and minimal regulatory rules on crypto investments in UK). The BTC price went so high, so fast, that the company soon faced a major liquidity crisis. As investors started to try selling or withdrawing their Bitcoins to realise their gains, the company began what would become a pattern with customers...sudden account lock-outs freezing funds under the pretext of 'security compliance checks' which it managed to exploit drag out for months, and in some cases well over a year...with customers seeing their investments lose considerably value as they couldn't access their accounts. The company was clearly hoping the BTC price would more significantly lower and it could resolve its liquidity problem and continue trading somehow. However it ended up with over ¬£60 million of crypto-currency liabilities on its balance sheet at the financial year end it was unable to repay and eventually practically losing its license which is now so heavily restricted it can't do anything except allow clients to withdraw funds.

The only recourse investors had was civil litigation (which I was involved in bringing successfully) since the regulators and Ombudsman were no help at all astonishingly, despite the obvious malpractice and blatant fraudulent activities by the company, because it involved crypto-currency investments which were beyond the scope of their regulation. Unfortunately that particular company (Wirex) and the full scale and extent of the fraud and risks to crypto investors it exposed has never been fully revealed or the company exposed in the media. Astonishingly, the company continues to operate, it holds that restricted FCA license and uses it on its websites and companies operated outside the UK to give investors a misleading impression that it's a London-based fully licensed and regulated investment firm, which is entirely not the case. They have gone on to setup companies in Ireland, Gibraltar and in Eastern Europe. And have managed to gain licenses in other countries to continue investment activities, because they weren't fully exposed and regulators in the UK didn't take action and completely revoke their license. The people behind Wirex are real rogues, they moved offices three times during our fraud investigation which eventually required the Serious Fraud Office and Trading Standards to track down the two Russian directors behind it.",Paul Langton-Rogers,0

Also it‚Äôs funny how people expect realness from people in the spotlight that would do life if their self incrimination was legit. Besides it‚Äôs crazy how much the industry is putting into rappers that promote negativity on all levels. Dumb decision making that will make you go broke aswell as bringing further tragedy to the hood that‚Äôs already war ridden with gang violence, robberies and murder which all occurs within the community. As someone who‚Äôs lived that life I can say that those who rap about it and still do it go to prison like chi ali, tay kay and melly. A few others have either stopped before it got serious to rap about it, or magically got out after shit was hot already (gucci, chief keef, bibby, durk etc), while most simply never did it like 69.
The bad aspect of social media is that everyone‚Äôs only showing you the great moments of that life (and mostly it‚Äôs fake and staged) but no one shows you the everyday shit like all your homies funerals you attend in your teens n 20s and all the siblings of your dead homies that turn to drugs and become homeless or take their own lives. I used to live across a building where every year at least one person jumped to their death before I made it out the projects. This shit is real n not no disney show. You can‚Äôt turn it off. You can‚Äôt escape this reality. And a lot of us out here have lived it and many more are still living it rn. The hood is an open air death camp. You don‚Äôt wanna live like this.

Half of them were prescribed happy pills because they were depressed. They drank a lot of wine. They were always having swinger parties and wife swapping was a big thing. Over time we missed the old life of being around real people and everyone sticking together to get through tough times. Being rich isn't what we thought it would be and wasn't like it's portrayed in media. Took 8 years to spend it all and by the end, we were happy it was gone.

Checklist: 

‚Ä¢ A bottle of water, at least 1liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrateüíß

‚Ä¢ Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the timeüîã

‚Ä¢ Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late-night study session, you won't wake up anyoneüéß

‚Ä¢ a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.‚òï

‚Ä¢ Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone, a few pens, paper or whatever you need.‚å®

‚Ä¢Anything else you could need, what about a heating pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy üêà


Reminder: After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it's cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. 
You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that's even better than listening to music while reading the book. (¬¥‚ñΩ` É‚ô°∆™)

I hope y'all had a good day, if not, that's okay too. Remember to take care of yourself and try to get some sleep tonight üò¥üß∏

#NAME?,the slap but with ragdoll physics,UgxxvTW1kE7uC6xIoXV4AaABAg.9_ApznQrQZd9o0jamOiT5H,"Guys, here is the Savior

YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified/Pierced for our sins and ‚ÄúHERE IS THE PROOF‚Äù

From the Ancient Egyptian Semitic:¬†
""Yad He Vav He"" is what Moshe (Moses) wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)

Ancient Egyptian Semitic Direct Translation
Yad - ""Behold The Hand""
He - ""Behold the Breath""
Vav - ""Behold The NAIL"" <‚Äî YaH‚Äôs Crucifixion
He - ""Behold the Breath""

‚ÄúBehold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL‚Äù¬†

PROVES - YAH The Heavenly Father HIMSELF was Who they Crucified

That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote

Here is what they mean

YaH's Name:
(Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: ""this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations"" (Exodus 3)

YaH is The Creator of ‚ÄúMAN‚Äù: (Genesis 2:7)
Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's ""HAND"" Formed man from the dust ¬†of the Earth and His ""BREATH"" made him a living being (Adam)

YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion for ‚ÄúMAN‚Äù:
Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the ""NAIL"" through YaH‚Äôs ""HAND"", in Sacrifice of Crucifixion, that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His ‚ÄúBREATH‚Äù brings forth life (Salvation)

How YaH arrives:
YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11, Isaiah 54, 55), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...

Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified:
YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be NAILED/PIERCED on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...

HE WAS YaH!!!

HalleluYAH translates ‚ÄúPraise ye YaH‚Äù

The Hebrew Book of Isaiah

Isaiah 42:8
""I am YaH; that is my Name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.

Isaiah 43:11
I, I am YAH, and there is no other Savior but Me.

Isaiah 45:5
I am YaH, and there is none else.",Darrell Moore,0
