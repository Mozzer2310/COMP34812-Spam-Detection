And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
Before
Bedsheets, no clothes
Touch me like nobody else does
Lovely to just lay here with you
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos
But it's over
Then you're drivin' me home
And it kinda comes out as I get up to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before

And you don't exist

""Kick with your knee"" Keep your heel back against your hammy until your knee is down to the ball.. and then drop your foot to the ball.¬†It gives a whipping effect

There are 2 aspects of the topic shooting with power, 1: technique, which this video revolves around, and secondly: physical ability like agility and raw power.
A few tips, the shot i tried to master through my playing days was the Roberto Carlos like all-in style from distance. As a big kid i grew my legs to a huge size(86cm thighs and 51 cm. calves) by doing a lot of accelerations on my mountainbike, i rode that thing everywhere, so those wide tires and always pushing myself to the limit on the bike helped develop quick fibered musclemass. I also had a thing with stairs, i never just did one step, i always did 2 og 3 steps at the time. 
I think an underated thing about shooting with power is agility and flexibility. If you practice thorough stretching after efforts, your muscles and ligaments will gain some length which in the kicking of the ball will add some free movement, which will increase power in the followthrough, also there is the lowering of risk of injuries.
When i praticed i kicked as hard as i could everytime, that i think also gained power over the years, but could i go back i'd take 5 percent of the top and focus a lot more on technique. 
I got the power up to where i have never seen anyone kick as hard as I could, but my technique was flawed at best. And i could kick so hard that I was afraid of hitting the wall, that was always my main concern! I know as a 17 year old, that i kicked 127km/t that was the last measument of it i know, but at 20 -21 it was much harder, maybe 140-150 km/t. The ball whistled in the air!

Think of your foot and its motion like a cue stick when playing pool.
Approach on an angle (about 45 angle) and lunge onto the the ball.. leaning to the side and lean back enough to make sure knee is behind the ball but also try keeping upper body vertical (body shape look like 4 to 5 o'clock) Going on an angle lets your foot contact more of the underside of the ball.
*Side note*
The fear of toes hitting the ground takes a while for some to overcome but leaning to the side makes it physically impossible. 

Put ALL your energy and thrust once your foot is a ball length PAST the ball.. and follow through is just as important.. so make sure your 'cue stick' leg/foot motion gives it the upwards direction.

If you're in a fight.. your hardest kick wouldn't need a run up right? So neither does your longest distance kick.. 1 or 2 steps is easily done.

If your knee is over the ball it will never go upwards. Try kicking it as you did but push your hip slightly forward and follow your body through the ball.
Lean back a little more and kicking knee behind the ball if you want it to go high. (gotta get under it to lift)",djfunkychicken,ham

I was shocked how clearly more training she had at the start with the dodging and moving, but more impressed with how amazingly you recovered from that and got yourself grounded again. It looked like her strategy was to almost duck her head, like she knew you trained for her height and wanted to take away even more power and height to make it harder to hit her. A couple of times it looked like you were close to just taking the top of her head off when she ducked in. Amazing performance given the circumstance!",Zachary Fountain,ham

Russia can¬¥t even beat Ukraine, they have zero chance against NATO. They¬¥d lose Moscow in weeks. Russia only has one card to play, and it¬¥s the nuclear war card. But we can¬¥t live in a world where nations with nuclear weapons (which many nations can get if they want) can blackmail everyone else with this suicide card. So in that sense it becomes meaningless.

There is a whole spectrum of moral culpability when it comes to theft, and it's not just pure ethics, it factors into the law regarding shoplifting too.

Patriotism is not very popular in Germany, as you stated in your video. This pride has led to horrible things happening and when you think about it, is there a reason for patriotism? For most people it is not really an accomplishment to be in a country. But what is more common is ""city patriotism"". Your village, town or city is more direct to you.

While we should never forget the millions of innocent people who lost their lives in that awful time and the dangerous progaganda that enabled such a thing to happen, I also feel that today's generation of Germans should be allowed to enjoy their lives without being riddled by the guilt of the past. In England, we study WWI and WWII for a year or so, and, for me, that was certainly sufficient enough to give me a rounded understanding of our past.",English with Ease | Daniella Wood,ham

The only aspect added in Austria is the ""Anschluss"", which was rather important as it was the reason that got us involved. It's interesting to hear the first time. The second time, you think ""alright, some revision doesn't harm""... and then comes the third time you learn about this period, going even deeper into...well, everything about Nazi-Germany, except for their military operations. And this time, it takes more than a semester to be taught about...honestly, quite annoying. For two reasons:
1. we could cover so many eras of history in-depth instead, without going anywhere near ""ignoring"" WWII. For example, we were taught about the Cold War within 3 weeks, that's 6 hours of class. If it wasn't for my own research and interest, I wouldn't associate anything with (that monster) Mao besides a name. Nazis were monsters, of course. But so were Lenin, Stalin, Mao and that guy in Cambodia. 
2. It is taught with the intention of ""learning from the past and not letting it repeat itself"". So, what's the issue? It is the ONLY part of history that is taught with that aim in mind. everything else is just remembering names, places, dates and years. Never ever have I heard something akin to ""You know, Rome accomplished many things, conquered many lands and even integrated their culture into their own, which is really impressive. But the one mistake they made was to put the current sovereign on a level with the principle of ""sovereignty"" itself. The ruler abided by no rules, couldn't be stopped by anything except for murder and here are the things that went south because of that. That is prove enough of why Totalitarianism doesn't work.""

-cgoSk_yg6k,How Do German Schools Teach About WWII?,Today I Found Out,UgydnEUllqvCI8H78m54AaABAg,"As a German that went through the school system (completed my ""Abitur"" in 2014 which qualifies you for higher education at a university), I can tell you that a lot of it depends on the teacher and thus that there's still a lot of variation how the topic is treated within singular schools at times. There was a teacher at my school where the students definitely felt an implied ""original sin"" being seemingly pressed on them despite them not having any hand in what the Nazis did. I heard him speak on the topic once or twice, and I understood the people in his class feeling that way. The type of guy that would apologize to a Jewish person for what our ancestors did. Like why? We know it was horrible and wrong, thje jews know it was horrible and wrong, and it should never be allowed to happen again. You didn't do it, so you shouldn't have to feel guilty for it because you had absolutely no hand in it. Most Germans I've talked to about it will tell you that sometimes teachers take it too far with the ""guilt because you happen to be German"" thing. Trust me, we know. We hear all about it in school, as mentioned in the video. They focus a lot on the holocaust, and that's the primary and most monstrous atrocity committed by the Nazis. You read books that portray how the discrimination, segregation and finally extermination of ""unwanted elements"" (not only Jews, but Sinti and Roma people as well for instance) actually worked and gradually became worse and worse. And the caution on what to show your young students and what might be too much for them to digest often goes right out the window when this topic is being dealt with, and I think rightfully so. Seeing a few graphic images helps you take it for what it truly was. We visited a former concentration camp on a class trip, we visited a museum that detailed the fate of a local Jewish community in a very rural place in our area, all of that. They went the extra mile.

TLDR: Especially the topic of the atrocities committed by the Nazis is taken very seriously and featured prominently, but some teachers take it too far with the ""guilt tripping"" aspect. Don't teach your students to feel guilty for it, they shouldn't, they had no hand in it. Teach them awareness and a responsible way of dealing with the topic.",FusRoDahYaFace,ham

I'm glad that I am from Germany, I'm very blessed to have grown up in a country like Germany but I'm still deeply ashamed of the past this nation has had.

[REPLY] For Runners it matters even WHAT are you stretching and WHEN. I followed a masterclass for this in a meeting of specialists coming from Canada and Italy, and the ratio was that it is good to stretch proximal muscles of the legs BEFORE running, but it is wise to stretch the others AFTER the activity. This is because the stiffness that you are targetting helps in the stability of the foot during the run.

g1pb2aK2we4,How stretching actually changes your muscles - Malachy McHugh,TED-Ed,UgyHw8rcJKDVGTEpoLx4AaABAg,"FINALLY, someone discusses this with nuance! I did medical massage for several years, and I was skeptical that this might be a problematically simplified video, but once the difference between dynamic and static was brought up early on, I knew this would be content that actually does some good. I'd have liked to see some clearer emphasis put on safety factors and the difference between pre-activity and post-activity stretching, and I don't quite like the characterization of proprioceptive limitation as ""pain threshold"", but overall this is a good resource and I'm mostly being nitpicky.

In case anyone sees this, the most important takeaways I think everyone should apply to stretching are: 1. Never hold static stretches at the absolute maximum intensity you can tolerate; instead, find that limit, then lessen the stretch just a tiny bit, then hold it there. It reduces injury risk and is a much more effective ""sweet spot"" for really benefiting. 2. Pressure sensation (such as that felt when a muscle is stretched) will ALWAYS override pain signals, but just because it feels good in the moment doesn't mean you're actually accomplishing anything; pay attention to whether you feel improvement a little while _after_ the stretch. Most people just hold static stretches long enough to feel good right then, instead of long enough to have lasting effect (holding a good 30 seconds or about 3 full breath cycles is about right), which is why it often ends up feeling like a waste of time to many. If you're going to bother doing it, commit to doing it right!

(Also, for those who really want to see radical effects on your range of motion, talk to your massage therapist or physical therapist about post-isometric relaxation or ""PIR"" stretching! Lots of my fellow CMTs might not know the method but many will, and most if not all PTs will know what's up. You can gain, _lastingly,_ up to maybe a dozen degrees or more of range of motion in one joint in just a few minutes, if the technique is done well!)","The plural is actually ""asparageese"".",ham

Those upper level abilities are the ones we should worry about, they will be the features only for sale to the select few/most wealthy. 
I would go so far as to say that gpt-4 was ready when we heard Elon warn over a year ago on twitter. They asked it: ""how should we release you to the public"" - guard rails free, it said something along the lines of: ""release in an apparent, iterative way. Give the public access to simple features such as sentence prediction... then slowly acclimate the population to higher level features from there"". Two fold, this also allowed the donors/stock holders the ability to get a head start on developing and expending the emergent capabilities - this seems to be the case due to the mass layoffs and firing across all the big tech companies as we've all seen.

Stocks are limited ‚Äì so grab yours before they‚Äôre gone for good! [REPLY] someones been playing ""stellaris : first contact"" lol üòÅ

to the uninitiated, stellaris is a galaxy wide real time strategy game from 2016 that takes place right as we develop the technology to travel to other stars, it has a lot of conflicts but also a lot of diplomacy and politics, the newest update ""first contact"" expands on a very old system that manages the observation, interference, and growth of other pre-sapient or pre-ftl civilizations in the galaxy, and in many cases it behaves exactly as shown in this video, a loud empire will grow and take over many star systems, if they have a policy of non-intervention and protected observation of pre-ftl species then cloaked observation outposts may be orbiting us right now and studying us, if they however have different policies of tolerance or intolerance then we could be easily swept away by aggressive terraforming projects or even purged by fanatic purifiers.

however the same can be said about us if we're in the galactic stage first, we could encounter other pre-ftl races within our sphere of influence, observe and guide them, uplift them only to become our servants, purge them with terraforming, planet crackers, neutron sweeps, orbital bombardment, or mass genocide, or alternatively embrace them as part of our empire, give them their independence, have them become our loyal vassals, and so on. if we are in fact first then we must be careful to tread our future diplomatically and politically since if we are malevolent others will seek to eliminate us, but if we are too benevolent they may take advantage of us. 

another theory is that we could be under the custodianship of a hyper advanced race that simply doesnt want to be bothered by the galactic community - a quiet empire so to speak. in stellaris there are 5 fallen empires which are hyper advanced civilizations with technologies that enter the realm of magic, one of these fallen empires are the enigmatic observers, whom are fond of protecting pre-sapient & pre-ftl civilizations within its dominion - away from the wider galaxy, thus enshrouding us from countless galactic wars that may already have come and gone.",chloe kaftan,ham

A book series that put this idea into perspective was The Lost Fleet: Beyond the Frontier. It explores a futuristic spacefaring humanity that just recovered from a galactic war amongst themselves, only to discover another intelligent species residing at the borders of their known space.

They dubbed these aliens the ""Enigma Race"" due to their elusive strategies. Their warships resembled vessels more like cruisers, they suicide-bombed any vessel that could potentially be captured, and even detonated bombs on their own colonized planets to prevent the humans from learning about them. Their evolution made them inherently secretive; an instinct that human scientists in the novel series compared to being as driven by as sex does to us humans. Just as we evolved to not stop thinking about reproduction and advancing our species, the Enigma race evolved to not stop thinking about concealing their race.

I feel like if there existed an intelligent alien race in the Milky Way, they'd most likely have to live by the Enigma race's sort of lifestyle. Which makes the possibility of encountering them a bit scary, to say the least.",TimeToEngage,ham

One was the Indian guy, who told me that he is an uber driver and he scammed me with a lot of money. Another guy was white american, who was wandering around different jfk airport terminals, as one of my cab driver dropped me at the right place. I was just entering through the gate, then that white guy asked me for which terminal I am looking for, which I told him & then he said this is the wrong terminal, let me drop u at right terminal, JFK airport team has appointed me for that. I trusted that guy, then he dropped me at the same terminal but at the different gate and asked me for a lot of money. He had the cctv camera in his car and he tried to convinced me in different ways like he called one girl and she said he is asking for small amount etc. When I tried to inform about tht incident to the cops, they said they can‚Äôt do anything with that even I suggested them to try to find that guy on airport‚Äôs CCTV, but they said they can‚Äôt help me with this. I was just trying to help other people to not get scammed by these guys, but it didn‚Äôt work. I also found so many scamming websites with the same official website names in the America, like paypal etc. They are also scamming people in the USA. I don‚Äôt know why all this is going there.

[REPLY] Absolutely, the absurdity of the whole thing should be obvious to most people with an ounce of common sense. 

Serious investment companies don't speak so informally with investment clients on the phone. They are usually very formal until some relationship is established and a personal investment advisor is assigned. And even at that stage, it would be speaking on a first name basis after asking if that's ok with the client..using 'darling' or 'love' to speak to female clients in an investment fund should be a red flag. It would be highly unprofessional, inappropriate conduct by an employee and unlikely to happen in real companies since most calls are routinely recorded by most large companies and an employee would be mindful of that and how they speak and interact with clients.

The other red flag was the initial contact call. When the person at the call centre was quizzed about which country they were in and from originally and couldn't give a straight answer and was evasive. 

Likewise, making random and speculator returns claims to a client is a massive red flag that you're not dealing with a legitimate investment funds advisor. No investment fund can promise any level of returns, and losses are a distinct possibility and risk. Most real investment funds make that clear to clients, they rarely suggest they can provide any return percentage over any short space of time and always remind investors that capital is at risk and investing is long-term proposition, not something you can expect quick or short-term returns from doing. When you have someone saying you can make 70-90% a week or a day even, you know you're talking to either a scammer or someone who is doing gambling rather than investing. If asked what kind of returns can be expected, a real investment fund would normally quote its average annual performance over a given period of time (or sometimes in their best trading year) and it's usually (for a good fund) something around 10-20% a year. 

It's up anyone investing in a managed equity or investment fund to probe them about historic performance over say the last 3 years, 5 years and 10 years...legitimate investment funds willl have charts of their historic performance on their website for you to look at for any given time period. 

Anyone who has done a bit of basic research online and understands the fundamental basics of investing and has a bit of basic insight into how managed investment funds work wouldn't be an easy victim for these types of scams. Most scammers who operate as badly as this one did would be exposed and fail on the initial contact call after answering a couple of basic questions and just in the way they come across so unprofessionally. 

Some people do fall for them though, as some scammers are quite clever at convincing people they are genuine and the returns are real, often going so far as to create an account getting a client to deposit say $100 and then showing a return of 50% in one week on the balance which you're free to withdraw. So then they're feeling confident the investment firm is safe and genuine. That then encourages someone to deposit more money, ie $1000, for the allure of even higher returns and an income potential. As soon their second deposit is made, their money is gone, along with the original deposit, a substantial portion of it (some excuse is given, ie the market going against them or the account becomes frozen for security checks or whatever). 

I involved in uncovering and bringing litigation against a multi-million pound crypto-currency fraud in the UK a few years ago. Investors lost $10,000's..the company was operated by two Russian's and was actually a fully licensed regulated firm in London with the world's first crypto-debit card. It seemed a totally legitimate company and had over 400 million users worldwide...but after doing some basic checks on the company, I saw red flags early on that the company was a rogue operationa and misleading investors into thinking it was something much bigger than it really was. 

It started off legitimate, but they misappropriated client funds and failed to back Bitcoin positions (exploiting the very relaxed and minimal regulatory rules on crypto investments in UK). The BTC price went so high, so fast, that the company soon faced a major liquidity crisis. As investors started to try selling or withdrawing their Bitcoins to realise their gains, the company began what would become a pattern with customers...sudden account lock-outs freezing funds under the pretext of 'security compliance checks' which it managed to exploit drag out for months, and in some cases well over a year...with customers seeing their investments lose considerably value as they couldn't access their accounts. The company was clearly hoping the BTC price would more significantly lower and it could resolve its liquidity problem and continue trading somehow. However it ended up with over ¬£60 million of crypto-currency liabilities on its balance sheet at the financial year end it was unable to repay and eventually practically losing its license which is now so heavily restricted it can't do anything except allow clients to withdraw funds.

The only recourse investors had was civil litigation (which I was involved in bringing successfully) since the regulators and Ombudsman were no help at all astonishingly, despite the obvious malpractice and blatant fraudulent activities by the company, because it involved crypto-currency investments which were beyond the scope of their regulation. Unfortunately that particular company (Wirex) and the full scale and extent of the fraud and risks to crypto investors it exposed has never been fully revealed or the company exposed in the media. Astonishingly, the company continues to operate, it holds that restricted FCA license and uses it on its websites and companies operated outside the UK to give investors a misleading impression that it's a London-based fully licensed and regulated investment firm, which is entirely not the case. They have gone on to setup companies in Ireland, Gibraltar and in Eastern Europe. And have managed to gain licenses in other countries to continue investment activities, because they weren't fully exposed and regulators in the UK didn't take action and completely revoke their license. The people behind Wirex are real rogues, they moved offices three times during our fraud investigation which eventually required the Serious Fraud Office and Trading Standards to track down the two Russian directors behind it.",Paul Langton-Rogers,ham

As someone who‚Äôs lived that life I can say that those who rap about it and still do it go to prison like chi ali, tay kay and melly. A few others have either stopped before it got serious to rap about it, or magically got out after shit was hot already (gucci, chief keef, bibby, durk etc), while most simply never did it like 69.
The bad aspect of social media is that everyone‚Äôs only showing you the great moments of that life (and mostly it‚Äôs fake and staged) but no one shows you the everyday shit like all your homies funerals you attend in your teens n 20s and all the siblings of your dead homies that turn to drugs and become homeless or take their own lives.

YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified/Pierced for our sins and ‚ÄúHERE IS THE PROOF‚Äù

From the Ancient Egyptian Semitic:¬†
""Yad He Vav He"" is what Moshe (Moses) wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)

Ancient Egyptian Semitic Direct Translation
Yad - ""Behold The Hand""
He - ""Behold the Breath""
Vav - ""Behold The NAIL"" <‚Äî YaH‚Äôs Crucifixion
He - ""Behold the Breath""

‚ÄúBehold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL‚Äù¬†

PROVES - YAH The Heavenly Father HIMSELF was Who they Crucified

That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote

Here is what they mean

YaH's Name:
(Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: ""this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations"" (Exodus 3)

YaH is The Creator of ‚ÄúMAN‚Äù: (Genesis 2:7)
Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's ""HAND"" Formed man from the dust ¬†of the Earth and His ""BREATH"" made him a living being (Adam)

YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion for ‚ÄúMAN‚Äù:
Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the ""NAIL"" through YaH‚Äôs ""HAND"", in Sacrifice of Crucifixion, that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His ‚ÄúBREATH‚Äù brings forth life (Salvation)

How YaH arrives:
YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11, Isaiah 54, 55), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...

Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified:
YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be NAILED/PIERCED on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...

HE WAS YaH!!!

HalleluYAH translates ‚ÄúPraise ye YaH‚Äù

The Hebrew Book of Isaiah

Isaiah 42:8
""I am YaH; that is my Name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.

Isaiah 43:11
I, I am YAH, and there is no other Savior but Me.

Isaiah 45:5
I am YaH, and there is none else.",Darrell Moore,spam

Came in for the embers
Stayed out for the breeze
I need to feel elements to remind me
There's beauty when it's bleak
Stuck out long before lights down
Why do I breathe? Oh, I know
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe, I won't
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't br–µak my boat
Stones crash on the boardwalk
The wind rush through th–µ trees
I'll keep my eyes peeled
The memories always fall short
Of what we could've been
Left out long before last call
What do I need? Oh, I know
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe, I won't
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't break my boat
The waves won't break my boat
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe, I won't
And the waves won't break my boat", ü è Ä…™·¥Ñs  ô è  ú·¥Ä Ä Ä è,ham

But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.

mMaBVfIedFw,Selfie Waves,Vsauce,UgygLt80y7oRQZCMySd4AaABAg,"I‚Äôve been watching your videos almost exclusively lately- truly the bulk of my watchable entertainment over the last month. Two MindField videos made me think you were going to address something I‚Äôve thought about for a long time actually and I‚Äôd love for you to explore it further. Essentially the topic is about how it seems (for most humans, including neurodiverse people like myself) that the more intelligence we have in one respect, the more we have to give up in another, maybe a few others. You addressed it regarding animals vs humans. And it was clear that music came as naturally to Derek Paravicini as communication does to most humans and vice versa. We know there are many different types of intelligence. I have viewed most of us as being around average in most ways, with some strengths and some weaknesses, still with no extreme deficits or surpluses. This is why the savants of the world get our attention. And it has always seemed to me that they do have what would be considered an extreme deficit in some area, due to the extreme surplus of intelligence in another. I also recently learned that hyperlexia is a condition to be ‚Äúdiagnosed.‚Äù Why would a child be considered ‚Äútoo good‚Äù at reading or understanding numbers? Why is there a list of ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù? Well it‚Äôs almost always accompanied by autism. Even just amongst neurotypical people, there has long been a trope of cool athletes (with great interpersonal and bodily-kinetic intelligence) to be ‚Äúdumb‚Äù (with low mathematical and linguistic intelligence) and nerds (with high mathematical and linguistic intelligence) to be awkward (with low athletic and interpersonal intelligence). Is there SOME basis for these assumptions? Anyways it‚Äôs all very fascinating to me. I guess the video I‚Äôd love to see from you boils down to 2 questions- Can anyone excel at everything? Does everyone essentially have the same threshold for intelligence, only different types expressed in different ways?


Basically, if every type of intelligence (logical, linguistic, musical, spatial, etc) could be measured in an accurate, numerical way, and everyone were to be tested on every type of intelligence, and we were add up each individual‚Äôs scores for each category, would we all essentially end up with the same final score? (I‚Äôd like to clarify that I‚Äôm speaking mostly of natural ability, not cases where someone may have been trained to do something well but it‚Äôs actually not natural for them.)",Ray Elle,neutral

The guns feel great, the movement and the maps are great and flow well. The aim assist is not that strong(coming from a controller player) aim assist in the recent cods is so strong and no sbmm in casual is so good. I just came back to mw2 after 2 weeks, hopped into snd and got zero kills because I was not playing at my skill level that I normally do since I was so rusty, also going from Xdefiant movement back to mw2 really made me realize how terrible the movement is in mw. I have Orion and everything and was still so lost wondering things like ""how do you even play this game again"" because there's just nothing to do. No mechanics to learn and use or anything you just run around and shoot people and holy do guns aim slow. I will definitely grind out Xdefiant camos and challenges and what's even better?

However, I really worry about the future of kids like this having apparently not been brought up to know the true value of money, and being thrust into the spotlight like this.

Originally the main house, which was 5 floors, was connected to a house in the next street (Chesterfield Street) which we bought for the staff. There was an underground tunnel connecting the two houses, which was tunnelled underneath the courtyard. 
Brings back memories, and the Brunei Investment  Agency took it over from the Prince in around 2005.

NR5pWBy-6Fk,The Insane Engineering of the M1 Abrams,Real Engineering,UgyCxjyeJkUhx3UPQ4N4AaABAg,"Actually one of the reasons why the Turbine engine was chosen over a diesel engine is because of noise. While the Turbine engine does produce a louder noise at closer distances, at longer distances the diesel engine is louder because the higher frequency noise of the turbine easily dissipates over distance while the lower frequency of the diesel persists. 

Autoloaders are not a Russian unique mechanism. Some NATO tanks, heck even American vehicles use them like the French LeClerc tank, American M1128 MGS, Japanese Type 10, etc... The US even considered an autoloader for their MBTs during the MBT-70 program. The Autoloader fitted in the MBT-70 was the German Rheinmetall autoloader. While it was fast, it was ultimately unreliable. The US then opted for their own homemade autoloader which was more reliable but sacrificed loading speed.

Needless to say: With an Army base and an airstrip nearby you could see all sorts of military vehicles back then. C-130 and UH-60 regulary flew overhead and one evening I even could watch a night training of 4 Apache helicopters near my workplace... ü§ü",UncleManuel,ham

I hope that it's reliable in the field and doesn't require frequent servicing relative to diesel engines. While it seems to have some advantages like excellent torque, the fuel consumption and complexity strike me as disadvantages.

The torsion bar suspension does seem potentially problematic. I'd guess that even smaller mines or other explosives directed at the wheels could possibly bend or otherwise damage the long torsion bars, and it does seem like maintenance would be a challenge. I do hope that NATO countries can move to something like hydro-gas suspension for better serviceability in the future.

Kare-kare¬†is a¬†Philippine¬†stew¬†(kare¬†derives from ""curry"") that features a thick savory peanut sauce. It is generally made from a base of stewed¬†oxtail,¬†beef¬†tripe,¬†pork hocks, calves' feet,¬†pig's feet or trotters, various¬†cuts of pork, beef stew meat, and occasionally¬†offal. Vegetables, such as¬†eggplant,¬†Chinese cabbage, or other¬†greens,¬†daikon,¬†green beans,¬†okra, and¬†asparagus beans, are added. The stew is flavored with ground roasted¬†peanuts¬†or¬†peanut butter,¬†onions, and¬†garlic. It is colored with¬†annatto¬†and can be thickened with toasted or plain ground rice

Bulal√¥¬†is a¬†beef¬†dish from the¬†Philippines. It is a light colored soup that is made by cooking¬†beef shanks¬†and¬†bone marrow¬†until the¬†collagen¬†and fat has been melted into the clear¬†broth. It typically includes¬†leafy vegetables¬†(like¬†pechay¬†or¬†cabbage),¬†corn on the cob, scallions, onions, garlic, ginger, and fish sauce.¬†Potatoes,¬†carrots, or¬†taro¬†can also be added. It is commonly eaten on rice with soy sauce and¬†calamansi¬†on the side.

Sinigang¬†is a Filipino soup or stew characterized by its sour and savory taste. It is most often associated with¬†tamarind¬†(Filipino:¬†sampalok), although it can use other sour fruits and leaves as the souring agent. It is one of the more popular dishes in¬†Filipino cuisine.
¬†Sinigang¬†typically uses meat or seafood (e.g., fish, pork, beef, shrimp, or chicken) stewed with¬†tamarind,¬†tomatoes,¬†garlic, and¬†onions. Other vegetables commonly used in the making of sinigang include¬†okra,¬†taro¬†corms¬†(gabi adds a starchy component to the dish and thickens the broth[10]), white¬†radish¬†(laban√≥s),¬†water spinach¬†(kangk√≥ng),¬†yardlong beans¬†(sitaw) and¬†eggplant¬†(tal√≥ng). Most Filipinos like to cook sinigang with¬†long green peppers¬†in order to enhance the taste and add a little spice to the dish. Another variation includes adding locally made¬†miso.

4 For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough. (2 Corinthians 11:3, ESV)

1 Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand,
2 and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you-unless you believed in vain.
3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,
4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,
5 and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
6 Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. (1 Corinthians 15:1, ESV)

1 And you were dead in the trespasses and sins
2 in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience-
3 among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.
4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us,
5 even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ-by grace you have been saved-
6 and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
7 so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
8 For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,
9 not a result of works, so that no one may boast. (Ephesians 2:1, ESV)

38 For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,
39 nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 8:38, ESV)

13 In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,
14 who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory. (Ephesians 1:13, ESV)

11 And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
12 Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.
13 I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life. (1 John 5:11, ESV)

Even more disturbing is that Chapman may have been ‚Äúgroomed‚Äù by the CIA to carry out the killing, Whelan claimed, citing an unusual series of events preceding his trial.

‚ÄúChapman‚Äôs lawyers were aiming for a trial and an insanity plea, but out of the blue, Chapman decided he wanted to forgo a trial and plead guilty, claiming that ‚Äòa little voice inside his head‚Äô told him to do this,‚Äù said Whelan.

From The Daily Mail:

Crucially, says Whelan, that volte-face only came after Chapman was visited in his cell by various psychiatrists employed by his defence lawyers.

Three of those doctors had been involved in hypnosis, and one of them, Dr Milton Kline, worked with the CIA on its notorious ‚ÄòMK Ultra‚Äô mind control programme, which the Hollywood movie the Manchurian Candidate was loosely based on.

In 1979, Kline boasted in a TV documentary that a man could be programmed to murder via hypnosis, via the MK Ultra programme.

Why Kline, along with two other experts in hypnosis, was asked by the lawyers to meet Chapman, is not clear, though it is not impossible that the defence was already considering putting forward the notion that their client was hypnotised into carrying out his crime.

If true, this would mark yet another instance of U.S. intelligence involvement in the assassination of a peace-loving cultural icon who was critical of the military-industrial complex.

IohA4aOxtnA,Sudan army says foreign nationals to be evacuated as Khartoum fighting continues - BBC News,BBC News,UgyohxJTcAGfgueodNV4AaABAg,"The official account of Lennon‚Äôs assassination was that disturbed loner Mark David Chapman waited for Lennon outside the Dakota Building in Manhattan as he and his wife Yoko Ono returned to his apartment before shooting Lennon five times in the back.

But Whelan claims that the evidence he‚Äôs reviewed shows Lennon was shot in the chest, not the back.

‚ÄúI think Mark Chapman was potentially shooting a gun or thinking he was shooting a gun possibly blanks,‚Äù Whelan said.

‚ÄúHe thinks he‚Äôs done something he couldn‚Äôt have possibly done ‚Äî therefore, the only conclusion I can come to is there might have been a second shooter or it was highly likely there was a second shooter in the vestibule area on the stairs, shooting John in a close group pattern in his upper left chest area.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen I spoke to the doctors and nurses at the time who treated John ‚Äì and they saw his wounds many times ‚Äì they all agree that whoever shot John was very close to him and standing in front one or two feet away.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd they managed to achieve a very professional grouping around John‚Äôs left chest area above his heart. It‚Äôs almost impossible for Mark Chapman to do that from where he was and it was dark. He was 20 to 25 feet away from John.‚Äù",bladesmassive,spam

[REPLY] @Robert Phipps roflmao. You're missing the key statements in this explainers and failing to contextualise whom they're written for. You're so busy trying to prove yourself right that you've missed the forest for the trees. 

When the ECB talks about ‚Ç¨1 being worth less than the day before they're talking about devaluation. That devaluation happens are the currency side and crosses the whole of the supply chain. 

You're looking up short explainers for lay people where they're attempting to not get too bogged down in the weeds. They're all telling you about devaluation and it's effects on consumers without getting into the details. 

Instead of going to lay explainers trying to give a one line overview of a complicated economic feature, grab yourself an economics textbook and learn about how things interact to devalue a currency which then results separately in a rise to CPI. 

These things are all related to each other and CPI is often used as an inaccurate indicator of inflation but they are NOT the same thing. It's a nuance, and I don't blame you for getting confused, but an important one to note. Particularly if you're trying to understand why for example strikes directly increase inflation, or why profiteering does not. Indeed using CPI as an indicator of inflation is where many reserve banks (including the bank of England) went wrong, and were caught with their pants down on this inflationary cycle. Andrew Bailey has directly admitted that's where they went wrong on this very program. I suggest you check out his interview. 

Inflation starts and ends in banking. It's the direct result of how money is made through deposits. That's why there's so much talk about too much cash in the system. 

If inflation were merely CPI, there would be no cause to target 2-3% constant inflation. The argument would just be made that prices should just be stagnant across the supply chain. You also wouldn't see sudden sharp price rises across all industries by consistent amounts. How coordinated do you imagine industry is. lol. It certainly wouldn't be effected by government debt or levels of foreign investment. If it were merely CPI countries like Lebanon wouldn't be in the economic meltdown they're in, and Liz Truss' fairytale economics would have worked instead of causing a run on the market. 

2-3% inflation is targeted by reserve banks because it *creates* new money and drives investment. The nuance between devaluation and CPI is the difference between Liz Truss style policies and Rishi Sunack style polices. 

Profiteering is a crime across the whole of the OECD. Your method of evaluating profiteering is overly simplistic, highly inaccurate and fails to take all variables into account. I'm glad you're not in charge of a consumer protection agency, you'd tank the economy overnight. 

I enjoy that you went from claiming profiteering were the cause of inflation, eventually citing an internal report for unions to ""it's a factor"". ü§£ Profiteering is exceptionally difficult to demonstrate, I'm not going down that rabbit hole, you can look up the statute yourself. 

You've directly contradicted yourself in your last comment. You're claiming profiteering is driving inflation, but then claiming profiteering is driven by the crisis caused by high prices which you also claim is inflation. ü§£  That's some circular logic you've got going on there mate. 

The truth is you just don't understand what you're talking about. That's ok, but you shouldn't try to act otherwise. Listen to those of us whom do understand.",TJ Marx,ham

A lot of the sound is amplified is amplified by the hollow shape of the keycap over the switch. And then if the keycap hits the case when it bottoms out, that adds to the sound as well. Plus the case material adds to the sound and the type of sound you get. Aluminum, acrylic, wood. Filled with foam or hollow, weighted or plated. Are the keycaps double shot plastic? Brass? Acrylic-filled artisans? Stabilizers? Films? Lubes?
