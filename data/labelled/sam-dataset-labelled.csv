Came in for the embers
Stayed out for the breeze
I need to feel elements to remind me
There's beauty when it's bleak
Stuck out long before lights down
Why do I breathe? Oh, I know
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe, I won't
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't br–µak my boat
Stones crash on the boardwalk
The wind rush through th–µ trees
I'll keep my eyes peeled
The memories always fall short
Of what we could've been
Left out long before last call
What do I need? Oh, I know
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe, I won't
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't break my boat
The waves won't break my boat
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe, I won't
And the waves won't break my boat", ü è Ä…™·¥Ñs  ô è  ú·¥Ä Ä Ä è,ham

iphone has better performance but high end android is more comfortable to play with

mMaBVfIedFw,Selfie Waves,UgygLt80y7oRQZCMySd4AaABAg,"I‚Äôve been watching your videos almost exclusively lately- truly the bulk of my watchable entertainment over the last month. Two MindField videos made me think you were going to address something I‚Äôve thought about for a long time actually and I‚Äôd love for you to explore it further. Essentially the topic is about how it seems (for most humans, including neurodiverse people like myself) that the more intelligence we have in one respect, the more we have to give up in another, maybe a few others. You addressed it regarding animals vs humans. And it was clear that music came as naturally to Derek Paravicini as communication does to most humans and vice versa. We know there are many different types of intelligence. I have viewed most of us as being around average in most ways, with some strengths and some weaknesses, still with no extreme deficits or surpluses. This is why the savants of the world get our attention. And it has always seemed to me that they do have what would be considered an extreme deficit in some area, due to the extreme surplus of intelligence in another. I also recently learned that hyperlexia is a condition to be ‚Äúdiagnosed.‚Äù Why would a child be considered ‚Äútoo good‚Äù at reading or understanding numbers? Why is there a list of ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù? Well it‚Äôs almost always accompanied by autism. Even just amongst neurotypical people, there has long been a trope of cool athletes (with great interpersonal and bodily-kinetic intelligence) to be ‚Äúdumb‚Äù (with low mathematical and linguistic intelligence) and nerds (with high mathematical and linguistic intelligence) to be awkward (with low athletic and interpersonal intelligence). Is there SOME basis for these assumptions? Anyways it‚Äôs all very fascinating to me. I guess the video I‚Äôd love to see from you boils down to 2 questions- Can anyone excel at everything? Does everyone essentially have the same threshold for intelligence, only different types expressed in different ways?


Basically, if every type of intelligence (logical, linguistic, musical, spatial, etc) could be measured in an accurate, numerical way, and everyone were to be tested on every type of intelligence, and we were add up each individual‚Äôs scores for each category, would we all essentially end up with the same final score? (I‚Äôd like to clarify that I‚Äôm speaking mostly of natural ability, not cases where someone may have been trained to do something well but it‚Äôs actually not natural for them.)",Ray Elle,neutral

The aim assist is not that strong(coming from a controller player) aim assist in the recent cods is so strong and no sbmm in casual is so good. I just came back to mw2 after 2 weeks, hopped into snd and got zero kills because I was not playing at my skill level that I normally do since I was so rusty, also going from Xdefiant movement back to mw2 really made me realize how terrible the movement is in mw. I have Orion and everything and was still so lost wondering things like ""how do you even play this game again"" because there's just nothing to do.

I do my notes and am in more of a ""student"" mode in other parts of the day. For example, I am working on the Google Certificate for Data Analytics.

However, I really worry about the future of kids like this having apparently not been brought up to know the true value of money, and being thrust into the spotlight like this. Kids go through many different stages in their formative years, and with having everything handed to her on a plate at this age including the laughable entourage, what is she going to turn into in her late teens and beyond? I really hope she doesn‚Äôt change from the cute, articulate little person she is now, but somehow, Im sad to say, I think that its highly likely.

It occupies the old Brown's dept. store that pre-dates me, but cannot be ignored owing to the name inlaid in tiles at the entrance. The whole place creaks under foot. It's a very old building, and part of our rows - the buildings and walkways above street level, which date back to the 1600s.",jenny taylor,0

NR5pWBy-6Fk,The Insane Engineering of the M1 Abrams,UgyCxjyeJkUhx3UPQ4N4AaABAg,"Actually one of the reasons why the Turbine engine was chosen over a diesel engine is because of noise. While the Turbine engine does produce a louder noise at closer distances, at longer distances the diesel engine is louder because the higher frequency noise of the turbine easily dissipates over distance while the lower frequency of the diesel persists. 

Autoloaders are not a Russian unique mechanism. Some NATO tanks, heck even American vehicles use them like the French LeClerc tank, American M1128 MGS, Japanese Type 10, etc... The US even considered an autoloader for their MBTs during the MBT-70 program. The Autoloader fitted in the MBT-70 was the German Rheinmetall autoloader. While it was fast, it was ultimately unreliable. The US then opted for their own homemade autoloader which was more reliable but sacrificed loading speed.

This stuff is so classified that whenever there is a tank accident and the armor is exposed, they evacuate the area, throw a bunch of tarps onto everything and wait for a specialist team to show up.  I was at Knox (home of armor corps) during the development of the M1A2 SEP upgrade package and got to be involved in some of the prototypes the Mounted Maneuver Battle Lab (MMBL) was doing.

2. That an important mechanism of reactive armor is that HEAT projectiles where we hit perpendicular to the surface. As the outer plate of the ERA (Explosive Reactive Armor) goes toward the projectile the jet is forced to cut and elongated hole in the plate effectively using up more of the jet.

I hope that it's reliable in the field and doesn't require frequent servicing relative to diesel engines. While it seems to have some advantages like excellent torque, the fuel consumption and complexity strike me as disadvantages.

The torsion bar suspension does seem potentially problematic. I'd guess that even smaller mines or other explosives directed at the wheels could possibly bend or otherwise damage the long torsion bars, and it does seem like maintenance would be a challenge. I do hope that NATO countries can move to something like hydro-gas suspension for better serviceability in the future.

Kare-kare¬†is a¬†Philippine¬†stew¬†(kare¬†derives from ""curry"") that features a thick savory peanut sauce. It is generally made from a base of stewed¬†oxtail,¬†beef¬†tripe,¬†pork hocks, calves' feet,¬†pig's feet or trotters, various¬†cuts of pork, beef stew meat, and occasionally¬†offal. Vegetables, such as¬†eggplant,¬†Chinese cabbage, or other¬†greens,¬†daikon,¬†green beans,¬†okra, and¬†asparagus beans, are added. The stew is flavored with ground roasted¬†peanuts¬†or¬†peanut butter,¬†onions, and¬†garlic. It is colored with¬†annatto¬†and can be thickened with toasted or plain ground rice

Bulal√¥¬†is a¬†beef¬†dish from the¬†Philippines. It is a light colored soup that is made by cooking¬†beef shanks¬†and¬†bone marrow¬†until the¬†collagen¬†and fat has been melted into the clear¬†broth. It typically includes¬†leafy vegetables¬†(like¬†pechay¬†or¬†cabbage),¬†corn on the cob, scallions, onions, garlic, ginger, and fish sauce.¬†Potatoes,¬†carrots, or¬†taro¬†can also be added. It is commonly eaten on rice with soy sauce and¬†calamansi¬†on the side.

Sinigang¬†is a Filipino soup or stew characterized by its sour and savory taste. It is most often associated with¬†tamarind¬†(Filipino:¬†sampalok), although it can use other sour fruits and leaves as the souring agent. It is one of the more popular dishes in¬†Filipino cuisine.
¬†Sinigang¬†typically uses meat or seafood (e.g., fish, pork, beef, shrimp, or chicken) stewed with¬†tamarind,¬†tomatoes,¬†garlic, and¬†onions. Other vegetables commonly used in the making of sinigang include¬†okra,¬†taro¬†corms¬†(gabi adds a starchy component to the dish and thickens the broth[10]), white¬†radish¬†(laban√≥s),¬†water spinach¬†(kangk√≥ng),¬†yardlong beans¬†(sitaw) and¬†eggplant¬†(tal√≥ng). Most Filipinos like to cook sinigang with¬†long green peppers¬†in order to enhance the taste and add a little spice to the dish. Another variation includes adding locally made¬†miso.

4 For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough. (2 Corinthians 11:3, ESV)

1 Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand,
2 and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you-unless you believed in vain.
3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,
4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,
5 and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
6 Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. (1 Corinthians 15:1, ESV)

4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us,
5 even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ-by grace you have been saved-

7 so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.

38 For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,
39 nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 8:38, ESV)

13 In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,
14 who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory. (Ephesians 1:13, ESV)

11 And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.

4 For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough. (2 Corinthians 11:3, ESV)

1 Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand,
2 and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you-unless you believed in vain.
3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,
4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,
5 and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
6 Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. (1 Corinthians 15:1, ESV)

Even more disturbing is that Chapman may have been ‚Äúgroomed‚Äù by the CIA to carry out the killing, Whelan claimed, citing an unusual series of events preceding his trial.

‚ÄúChapman‚Äôs lawyers were aiming for a trial and an insanity plea, but out of the blue, Chapman decided he wanted to forgo a trial and plead guilty, claiming that ‚Äòa little voice inside his head‚Äô told him to do this,‚Äù said Whelan.

From The Daily Mail:

Crucially, says Whelan, that volte-face only came after Chapman was visited in his cell by various psychiatrists employed by his defence lawyers.

Three of those doctors had been involved in hypnosis, and one of them, Dr Milton Kline, worked with the CIA on its notorious ‚ÄòMK Ultra‚Äô mind control programme, which the Hollywood movie the Manchurian Candidate was loosely based on.

In 1979, Kline boasted in a TV documentary that a man could be programmed to murder via hypnosis, via the MK Ultra programme.

Why Kline, along with two other experts in hypnosis, was asked by the lawyers to meet Chapman, is not clear, though it is not impossible that the defence was already considering putting forward the notion that their client was hypnotised into carrying out his crime.

If true, this would mark yet another instance of U.S. intelligence involvement in the assassination of a peace-loving cultural icon who was critical of the military-industrial complex.

[REPLY] @Robert Phipps roflmao. You're missing the key statements in this explainers and failing to contextualise whom they're written for. You're so busy trying to prove yourself right that you've missed the forest for the trees. 

When the ECB talks about ‚Ç¨1 being worth less than the day before they're talking about devaluation. That devaluation happens are the currency side and crosses the whole of the supply chain. 

You're looking up short explainers for lay people where they're attempting to not get too bogged down in the weeds. They're all telling you about devaluation and it's effects on consumers without getting into the details. 

Instead of going to lay explainers trying to give a one line overview of a complicated economic feature, grab yourself an economics textbook and learn about how things interact to devalue a currency which then results separately in a rise to CPI. 

These things are all related to each other and CPI is often used as an inaccurate indicator of inflation but they are NOT the same thing. It's a nuance, and I don't blame you for getting confused, but an important one to note. Particularly if you're trying to understand why for example strikes directly increase inflation, or why profiteering does not. Indeed using CPI as an indicator of inflation is where many reserve banks (including the bank of England) went wrong, and were caught with their pants down on this inflationary cycle. Andrew Bailey has directly admitted that's where they went wrong on this very program. I suggest you check out his interview. 

Inflation starts and ends in banking. It's the direct result of how money is made through deposits. That's why there's so much talk about too much cash in the system. 

If inflation were merely CPI, there would be no cause to target 2-3% constant inflation. The argument would just be made that prices should just be stagnant across the supply chain. You also wouldn't see sudden sharp price rises across all industries by consistent amounts. How coordinated do you imagine industry is. lol. It certainly wouldn't be effected by government debt or levels of foreign investment. If it were merely CPI countries like Lebanon wouldn't be in the economic meltdown they're in, and Liz Truss' fairytale economics would have worked instead of causing a run on the market. 

2-3% inflation is targeted by reserve banks because it *creates* new money and drives investment. The nuance between devaluation and CPI is the difference between Liz Truss style policies and Rishi Sunack style polices. 

Profiteering is a crime across the whole of the OECD. Your method of evaluating profiteering is overly simplistic, highly inaccurate and fails to take all variables into account. I'm glad you're not in charge of a consumer protection agency, you'd tank the economy overnight. 

I enjoy that you went from claiming profiteering were the cause of inflation, eventually citing an internal report for unions to ""it's a factor"". ü§£ Profiteering is exceptionally difficult to demonstrate, I'm not going down that rabbit hole, you can look up the statute yourself. 

You've directly contradicted yourself in your last comment. You're claiming profiteering is driving inflation, but then claiming profiteering is driven by the crisis caused by high prices which you also claim is inflation. ü§£  That's some circular logic you've got going on there mate. 

The truth is you just don't understand what you're talking about. That's ok, but you shouldn't try to act otherwise. Listen to those of us whom do understand.",TJ Marx,0

A lot of the sound is amplified is amplified by the hollow shape of the keycap over the switch. And then if the keycap hits the case when it bottoms out, that adds to the sound as well. Plus the case material adds to the sound and the type of sound you get. Aluminum, acrylic, wood. Filled with foam or hollow, weighted or plated. Are the keycaps double shot plastic? Brass?
