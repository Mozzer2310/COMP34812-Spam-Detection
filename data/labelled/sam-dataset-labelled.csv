Came in for the embers
Stayed out for the breeze
I need to feel elements to remind me
There's beauty when it's bleak
Stuck out long before lights down
Why do I breathe? Oh, I know
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe, I won't
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't brеak my boat
Stones crash on the boardwalk
The wind rush through thе trees
I'll keep my eyes peeled
The memories always fall short
Of what we could've been
Left out long before last call
What do I need? Oh, I know
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe, I won't
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't break my boat
The waves won't break my boat
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe, I won't
And the waves won't break my boat",ʟʏʀɪᴄs ʙʏ ʜᴀʀʀʏ,ham

We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.

Really helps u understand the difference and it's genuinely fun.

For example, lets say u give one phone a 8 and another a 7.5 for one category and for the next category u give the first phone a 2 and the second one a 9. If u just simply pick between them it might show that they are equal, but when u compare the total scores u will see a big difference!!",kool_kid,ham

mMaBVfIedFw,Selfie Waves,Vsauce,UgygLt80y7oRQZCMySd4AaABAg,"I’ve been watching your videos almost exclusively lately- truly the bulk of my watchable entertainment over the last month. Two MindField videos made me think you were going to address something I’ve thought about for a long time actually and I’d love for you to explore it further. Essentially the topic is about how it seems (for most humans, including neurodiverse people like myself) that the more intelligence we have in one respect, the more we have to give up in another, maybe a few others. You addressed it regarding animals vs humans. And it was clear that music came as naturally to Derek Paravicini as communication does to most humans and vice versa. We know there are many different types of intelligence. I have viewed most of us as being around average in most ways, with some strengths and some weaknesses, still with no extreme deficits or surpluses. This is why the savants of the world get our attention. And it has always seemed to me that they do have what would be considered an extreme deficit in some area, due to the extreme surplus of intelligence in another. I also recently learned that hyperlexia is a condition to be “diagnosed.” Why would a child be considered “too good” at reading or understanding numbers? Why is there a list of “symptoms”? Well it’s almost always accompanied by autism. Even just amongst neurotypical people, there has long been a trope of cool athletes (with great interpersonal and bodily-kinetic intelligence) to be “dumb” (with low mathematical and linguistic intelligence) and nerds (with high mathematical and linguistic intelligence) to be awkward (with low athletic and interpersonal intelligence). Is there SOME basis for these assumptions? Anyways it’s all very fascinating to me. I guess the video I’d love to see from you boils down to 2 questions- Can anyone excel at everything? Does everyone essentially have the same threshold for intelligence, only different types expressed in different ways?


Basically, if every type of intelligence (logical, linguistic, musical, spatial, etc) could be measured in an accurate, numerical way, and everyone were to be tested on every type of intelligence, and we were add up each individual’s scores for each category, would we all essentially end up with the same final score? (I’d like to clarify that I’m speaking mostly of natural ability, not cases where someone may have been trained to do something well but it’s actually not natural for them.)",Ray Elle,neutral

The aim assist is not that strong(coming from a controller player) aim assist in the recent cods is so strong and no sbmm in casual is so good. I just came back to mw2 after 2 weeks, hopped into snd and got zero kills because I was not playing at my skill level that I normally do since I was so rusty, also going from Xdefiant movement back to mw2 really made me realize how terrible the movement is in mw. I have Orion and everything and was still so lost wondering things like ""how do you even play this game again"" because there's just nothing to do.

I do my notes and am in more of a ""student"" mode in other parts of the day. For example, I am working on the Google Certificate for Data Analytics.

However, I really worry about the future of kids like this having apparently not been brought up to know the true value of money, and being thrust into the spotlight like this. Kids go through many different stages in their formative years, and with having everything handed to her on a plate at this age including the laughable entourage, what is she going to turn into in her late teens and beyond? I really hope she doesn’t change from the cute, articulate little person she is now, but somehow, Im sad to say, I think that its highly likely. Parents, take her away from the spotlight and let her grow up like a normal 10 year old, doing normal things and learn the value of money, hard work and dedication (like Yianni does with his kids) and she will turn out just fine.",Clive Hutton,ham

Originally the main house, which was 5 floors, was connected to a house in the next street (Chesterfield Street) which we bought for the staff. There was an underground tunnel connecting the two houses, which was tunnelled underneath the courtyard.

NR5pWBy-6Fk,The Insane Engineering of the M1 Abrams,Real Engineering,UgyCxjyeJkUhx3UPQ4N4AaABAg,"Actually one of the reasons why the Turbine engine was chosen over a diesel engine is because of noise. While the Turbine engine does produce a louder noise at closer distances, at longer distances the diesel engine is louder because the higher frequency noise of the turbine easily dissipates over distance while the lower frequency of the diesel persists. 

Autoloaders are not a Russian unique mechanism. Some NATO tanks, heck even American vehicles use them like the French LeClerc tank, American M1128 MGS, Japanese Type 10, etc... The US even considered an autoloader for their MBTs during the MBT-70 program. The Autoloader fitted in the MBT-70 was the German Rheinmetall autoloader. While it was fast, it was ultimately unreliable. The US then opted for their own homemade autoloader which was more reliable but sacrificed loading speed.

That was in 2002. It was dark and you could barely see these vehicles. It still amazes me that a 70 ton tank on rubber padded tracks can use a public road without making too much damage... 😲
Needless to say: With an Army base and an airstrip nearby you could see all sorts of military vehicles back then. C-130 and UH-60 regulary flew overhead and one evening I even could watch a night training of 4 Apache helicopters near my workplace... 🤟",UncleManuel,ham

I hope that it's reliable in the field and doesn't require frequent servicing relative to diesel engines. While it seems to have some advantages like excellent torque, the fuel consumption and complexity strike me as disadvantages.

The torsion bar suspension does seem potentially problematic. I'd guess that even smaller mines or other explosives directed at the wheels could possibly bend or otherwise damage the long torsion bars, and it does seem like maintenance would be a challenge. I do hope that NATO countries can move to something like hydro-gas suspension for better serviceability in the future.

Kare-kare is a Philippine stew (kare derives from ""curry"") that features a thick savory peanut sauce. It is generally made from a base of stewed oxtail, beef tripe, pork hocks, calves' feet, pig's feet or trotters, various cuts of pork, beef stew meat, and occasionally offal. Vegetables, such as eggplant, Chinese cabbage, or other greens, daikon, green beans, okra, and asparagus beans, are added. The stew is flavored with ground roasted peanuts or peanut butter, onions, and garlic. It is colored with annatto and can be thickened with toasted or plain ground rice

Bulalô is a beef dish from the Philippines. It is a light colored soup that is made by cooking beef shanks and bone marrow until the collagen and fat has been melted into the clear broth. It typically includes leafy vegetables (like pechay or cabbage), corn on the cob, scallions, onions, garlic, ginger, and fish sauce. Potatoes, carrots, or taro can also be added. It is commonly eaten on rice with soy sauce and calamansi on the side.

Sinigang is a Filipino soup or stew characterized by its sour and savory taste. It is most often associated with tamarind (Filipino: sampalok), although it can use other sour fruits and leaves as the souring agent. It is one of the more popular dishes in Filipino cuisine.
 Sinigang typically uses meat or seafood (e.g., fish, pork, beef, shrimp, or chicken) stewed with tamarind, tomatoes, garlic, and onions. Other vegetables commonly used in the making of sinigang include okra, taro corms (gabi adds a starchy component to the dish and thickens the broth[10]), white radish (labanós), water spinach (kangkóng), yardlong beans (sitaw) and eggplant (talóng). Most Filipinos like to cook sinigang with long green peppers in order to enhance the taste and add a little spice to the dish. Another variation includes adding locally made miso.

4 For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough. (2 Corinthians 11:3, ESV)

1 Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand,
2 and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you-unless you believed in vain.
3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,
4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,
5 and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
6 Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. (1 Corinthians 15:1, ESV)

1 And you were dead in the trespasses and sins
2 in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience-
3 among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.
4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us,
5 even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ-by grace you have been saved-
6 and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
7 so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
8 For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,
9 not a result of works, so that no one may boast. (Ephesians 2:1, ESV)

38 For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,
39 nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 8:38, ESV)

13 In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,
14 who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory. (Ephesians 1:13, ESV)

11 And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
12 Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.

Even more disturbing is that Chapman may have been “groomed” by the CIA to carry out the killing, Whelan claimed, citing an unusual series of events preceding his trial.

“Chapman’s lawyers were aiming for a trial and an insanity plea, but out of the blue, Chapman decided he wanted to forgo a trial and plead guilty, claiming that ‘a little voice inside his head’ told him to do this,” said Whelan.

From The Daily Mail:

Crucially, says Whelan, that volte-face only came after Chapman was visited in his cell by various psychiatrists employed by his defence lawyers.

Three of those doctors had been involved in hypnosis, and one of them, Dr Milton Kline, worked with the CIA on its notorious ‘MK Ultra’ mind control programme, which the Hollywood movie the Manchurian Candidate was loosely based on.

In 1979, Kline boasted in a TV documentary that a man could be programmed to murder via hypnosis, via the MK Ultra programme.

Why Kline, along with two other experts in hypnosis, was asked by the lawyers to meet Chapman, is not clear, though it is not impossible that the defence was already considering putting forward the notion that their client was hypnotised into carrying out his crime.

If true, this would mark yet another instance of U.S. intelligence involvement in the assassination of a peace-loving cultural icon who was critical of the military-industrial complex.

But Whelan claims that the evidence he’s reviewed shows Lennon was shot in the chest, not the back.

“I think Mark Chapman was potentially shooting a gun or thinking he was shooting a gun possibly blanks,” Whelan said.

“He thinks he’s done something he couldn’t have possibly done — therefore, the only conclusion I can come to is there might have been a second shooter or it was highly likely there was a second shooter in the vestibule area on the stairs, shooting John in a close group pattern in his upper left chest area.”

“When I spoke to the doctors and nurses at the time who treated John – and they saw his wounds many times – they all agree that whoever shot John was very close to him and standing in front one or two feet away.”

[REPLY] @Robert Phipps roflmao. You're missing the key statements in this explainers and failing to contextualise whom they're written for. You're so busy trying to prove yourself right that you've missed the forest for the trees. 

When the ECB talks about €1 being worth less than the day before they're talking about devaluation. That devaluation happens are the currency side and crosses the whole of the supply chain. 

You're looking up short explainers for lay people where they're attempting to not get too bogged down in the weeds. They're all telling you about devaluation and it's effects on consumers without getting into the details. 

Instead of going to lay explainers trying to give a one line overview of a complicated economic feature, grab yourself an economics textbook and learn about how things interact to devalue a currency which then results separately in a rise to CPI. 

These things are all related to each other and CPI is often used as an inaccurate indicator of inflation but they are NOT the same thing. It's a nuance, and I don't blame you for getting confused, but an important one to note. Particularly if you're trying to understand why for example strikes directly increase inflation, or why profiteering does not. Indeed using CPI as an indicator of inflation is where many reserve banks (including the bank of England) went wrong, and were caught with their pants down on this inflationary cycle. Andrew Bailey has directly admitted that's where they went wrong on this very program. I suggest you check out his interview. 

Inflation starts and ends in banking. It's the direct result of how money is made through deposits. That's why there's so much talk about too much cash in the system. 

If inflation were merely CPI, there would be no cause to target 2-3% constant inflation. The argument would just be made that prices should just be stagnant across the supply chain. You also wouldn't see sudden sharp price rises across all industries by consistent amounts. How coordinated do you imagine industry is. lol. It certainly wouldn't be effected by government debt or levels of foreign investment. If it were merely CPI countries like Lebanon wouldn't be in the economic meltdown they're in, and Liz Truss' fairytale economics would have worked instead of causing a run on the market. 

2-3% inflation is targeted by reserve banks because it *creates* new money and drives investment. The nuance between devaluation and CPI is the difference between Liz Truss style policies and Rishi Sunack style polices. 

Profiteering is a crime across the whole of the OECD. Your method of evaluating profiteering is overly simplistic, highly inaccurate and fails to take all variables into account. I'm glad you're not in charge of a consumer protection agency, you'd tank the economy overnight. 

I enjoy that you went from claiming profiteering were the cause of inflation, eventually citing an internal report for unions to ""it's a factor"". 🤣 Profiteering is exceptionally difficult to demonstrate, I'm not going down that rabbit hole, you can look up the statute yourself. 

You've directly contradicted yourself in your last comment. You're claiming profiteering is driving inflation, but then claiming profiteering is driven by the crisis caused by high prices which you also claim is inflation. 🤣  That's some circular logic you've got going on there mate. 

The truth is you just don't understand what you're talking about. That's ok, but you shouldn't try to act otherwise. Listen to those of us whom do understand.",TJ Marx,ham

I may have to get some. Ugh. So satisfying. Thank you for sharing. [REPLY] ​@phrogbot Actually that's incorrect. Any switch, no matter how clicky is that loud. A lot of the sound is amplified is amplified by the hollow shape of the keycap over the switch. And then if the keycap hits the case when it bottoms out, that adds to the sound as well. Plus the case material adds to the sound and the type of sound you get. Aluminum, acrylic, wood. Filled with foam or hollow, weighted or plated. Are the keycaps double shot plastic? Brass? Acrylic-filled artisans? Stabilizers? Films? Lubes? 

All of these components and their endless combinations form the symphony of sound that is a mechanical keyboard.",Angela,ham
